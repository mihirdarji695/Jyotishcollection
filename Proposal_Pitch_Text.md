## Slide 2: The Challenge (Why do we need this?)
*   **Decision Paralysis**: Customers typically leave when overwhelmed by too many options.
*   **Navigation Issues**: Finding a specific "Red Kurti in Size L" takes too many clicks on a standard website.
*   **Missed Opportunities**: Human support cannot be online 24/7 to catch every visitor who has a simple question.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Meet Your Virtual Personal Shopper**
It is not just a standard chatbot; it is a visual sales tool integrated directly into your website.
*   **Always On**: Greets visitors instantly.
*   **Interactive**: Customers click buttons instead of typing long sentences.
*   **Visual**: Displays product images, prices, and stock indicators inside the chat window.

## Slide 4: Key Features
1.  **Instant "New Arrivals" Showcase**: Push your latest products immediately to visitors.
2.  **Smart Color & Size Filters**: 
    *   *Customer*: "Do you have red?" 
    *   *Bot*: Instantly shows the Red collection.
3.  **Stock Urgency**: Automatically displays tags like "Only 3 Left!" to encourage quick buying.

## Slide 5: The "Wow" Factor (User Journey)
We have simplified the path to purchase:
1.  **Ask**: "Show me Kurtis."
2.  **View**: See a carousel of product cards with images.
3.  **Action**: Click "Shop Now" -> Added to Cart.

*Result*: A seamless experience that feels like chatting with a shop assistant in a physical store.
